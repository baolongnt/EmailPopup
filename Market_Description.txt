Email Popup is a simple app that displays a dialog for a few seconds every time an email is received.

You can select how long the popup stays on & configure the app to filter out emails so that only the important ones do popup.

* Only works with K-9 Mail *

* Internet access is only used for anonymous crash reporting *
